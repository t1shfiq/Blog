                        <div class="post-text"> I joined IBM during January 2020 to commence my 12-month internship as a Technical Analyst for IBM Cognos Business Intelligence at the beautiful Riverside location in Ottawa. I was so excited and kind of nervous for day one, this is my first time stepping foot in a corporate world. I vividly remember that morning, it was -20 outside and I took an Uber to office as I was scared of being late.</div>
